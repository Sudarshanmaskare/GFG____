Given a string S, find the longest repeating non-overlapping substring in it. In other words find 2 identical substrings of maximum
length which do not overlap. If there exists more than one such substring return any of them. Print the longest non-overlapping substring. 
If no such substring exists print -1.

Note: Multiple Answers are possible but you have to print the substring which occurs atleat twice first.

For Example: "ablhiabohi". Here both "ab" and "hi" are possible answers. But you will have to return "ab" as because it repeats before "hi".

 




string longestSubstring(string S, int N) {
        // code here
        int idx=0;
        int res=0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(N+1,vector<int>(N+1,0));
        
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<=N;j++){
                
                if(S[i-1]==S[j-1] && i!=j){
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+1;
                    
                    if(res<dp[i][j]){
                        res=dp[i][j];
                        idx=i-res;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if(res<=0) return "-1";
        string ans="";
        for(int i=idx;i<idx+res;i++){
            ans+=S[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
